# Comida da Boa

A next.js website, statically rendered, hosted on github pages with client side search powered by [minisearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minisearch) for me to keep my recipes written in [cooklang](https://cooklang.org/).

#### TODO

- [X] basic search
- [ ] full text search
- [ ] generate JSON-LD so that google can understand the recipes
- [ ] shopping list
- [ ] portion scaling
- [ ] RSS feed?? maybe
- [ ] i18n ?? maybe
- [ ] magic timers ?? maybe
- [ ] condensed view for recipes (merge ingredients and instructions)
